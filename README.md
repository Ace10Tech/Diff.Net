# Diff.Net

This is a differencing utility for Windows desktop written in C#.  It provides side-by-side differencing for files and directories.  For files it also provides an overview diff and a line-to-line diff.  It can also do a visual difference of binary files.

This project started in 2002, and it depends heavily on the [Menees.Diffs and Menees.Diffs.Windows.Forms libraries](https://github.com/bmenees/Libraries) for differencing algorithms and controls.
